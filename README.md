# 1 Win Aviator: How to Play and Win Big

## What is 1 Win Aviator?

1 Win Aviator is a popular crash game that is offered by many online
casinos in India. The game is based on a simple concept: a plane takes
off and flies higher and higher, and you have to cash out before the
plane crashes. The higher the plane flies, the bigger your payout will
be, but the risk of the plane crashing also increases.
